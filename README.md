# safecast
 
 [Safecast](https://safecast.org/) is a global volunteer-driven project that emerged in response to the March 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan. After the disaster, there was a significant public demand for accurate radiation level data. However, available information was sparse. Recognizing the lack of accessible and reliable radiation data, a group of volunteers, including technologists, engineers, designers, and activists, came together to create Safecast. They developed open-source Geiger counters and began mapping radiation levels in Fukushima and other affected areas.

 This project not only aims at developing a set of utilities to work with Safacast measurements data, but more importantly help students to understand and make decisions about their environments. This is in the context of a Year 9 school project.
 
 We will be introducing the students to the muliple facets of the Safecast projects, including but not limited to: 
 
- Open-source Hardware
- Data Collection and processing
- Open, Democratized Data
- Global Scope and Perspective
- Education and Outreach
